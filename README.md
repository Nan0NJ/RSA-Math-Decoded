# RSA Math Decoded

This repository contains my article on the RSA cryptosystem, exploring its mathematical underpinnings and operational mechanics. Written by Nenad Jakovchevski, it dives into the number theory that powers one of cryptography’s cornerstone algorithms.

## Overview
The RSA cryptosystem relies on elegant mathematical concepts—prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and computational complexity—to secure digital communication. This article breaks it down:

- **Mathematical Foundations**: Covers prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and key theorems like Fermat’s Little Theorem.
- **Algorithm Details**: Explains key generation, encryption, and decryption, with a worked example.
- **Proofs and Security**: Includes a proof of correctness and analysis of vulnerabilities like small exponent attacks.
- **Purpose**: To offer a clear, detailed look at RSA’s math for those curious about cryptography’s theoretical roots.

## Files
- **[RSA_Cryptosystem.pdf](RSA_Cryptosystem.pdf)**: The complete article, formatted with equations and examples (March 30, 2025).
- **`src/` (optional)**: LaTeX source files, if you’d like to compile or modify the document yourself.

## Motivation
I created this article to help others grasp the mathematics driving RSA—primes, modular arithmetic, and beyond. The reasoning behind it is simple: breaking down these concepts makes cryptography’s power more approachable, especially for those keen to see how number theory secures our digital world.
